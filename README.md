# Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery and High Availability Using AWS and Azure

## Overview

In today’s cloud-native environments, reliance on a single cloud provider poses a significant risk to application availability and business continuity during outages. Organizations require resilient architectures that can withstand cloud service disruptions without impacting user experience or causing financial losses.

This project addresses the challenge of ensuring **high availability** and **disaster recovery** by implementing a **multi-cloud failover architecture**. The solution involves deploying an application that runs primarily on **AWS**, with an automated failover to **Azure** in the event of a service outage.

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform** – for infrastructure provisioning  
- **Ansible** – for configuration management  
- **Jenkins** – for CI/CD automation  
- **AWS Route 53** – for DNS-based health checks and traffic failover

## Objectives

This approach aims to achieve:

- ✅ Continuous service availability during cloud outages  
- ✅ Minimized downtime and seamless user experience  
- ✅ Fully automated, infrastructure-as-code disaster recovery mechanisms
